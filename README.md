This is a project repository for the coding challenge of making a data extraction tool, given to me by GEGO, for a chance at an internship position at their company.

The project scope was as follows: 

To develop an application in Python that can compare a MS-Word Template file and the MS-Word file generated from the template and then extract the fieldname & fieldvalue in a CSV file. 
The application need not be an Web App. Just build as a normal command line tool initially.
The usage can be as follows: convert.py --template <your_template_file.docx> --document <your_doc_from_template.docx> --out output.csv.
