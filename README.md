The project scope was as follows: 

To develop an application in Python that can compare a MS-Word Template file and the MS-Word file generated from the template and then extract the fieldname & fieldvalue in a CSV file. 
The application need not be an Web App. Just build as a normal command line tool initially.
The usage can be as follows: 

convert.py --template <your_template_file.docx> --document <your_doc_from_template.docx> --out output.csv.

The two files I used to achieve the above specifications are also attached in this repository as ".docx" files
